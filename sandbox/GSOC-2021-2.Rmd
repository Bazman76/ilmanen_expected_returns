# Background

As witnessed by recent events, the lack of portfolio diversification and risk control can severely impact the financial goals and long term plans for individual investment accounts, 
retirement accounts, University Endowment funds, and Municipal Pension funds alike. 
And as recent examples of speculative booms and busts have revealed (GameStop), 
investors sometime exhibit a lack of diversification among their securities holdings, and investments are not as safe as they initially seem.

In this project, you shall explore and implement several investment strategies in `R`, as inspired by one of the most interesting investment references on the topic 
[Expected Returns: _An Investors Guide to Harvesting Market Rewards_](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Expected+Returns%3A+An+Investor%27s+Guide+to+Harvesting+Market+Rewards-p-9781119990727) by 
[Antti Ilmanen](https://www.aqr.com/About-Us/OurFirm/Antti-Ilmanen).

From the Description;

> This comprehensive reference delivers a toolkit for harvesting market rewards 
from a wide range of investments. Written by a world-renowned industry expert, 
the reference discusses how to forecast returns under different parameters. 
Expected returns of major asset classes, investment strategies, and the effects 
of underlying risk factors such as growth, inflation, liquidity, and different 
risk perspectives, are also explained. Judging expected returns requires 
balancing historical returns with both theoretical considerations and current 
market conditions. Expected Returns provides extensive empirical evidence, 
surveys of risk-based and behavioral theories, and practical insights.

# Related work

Your objective will be to reproduce key approaches suggested by the text and test 
performance on current market conditions with `R`. You will use functions found
in popular `R` in finance packages such as `FactorAnalytics`, 
`PerformanceAnalytics` and `PortfolioAnalytics`. But you will also need to write 
functions of your own to streamline workflows and implement solutions. While
these packages are excellent and widely used, there are gaps in the workflows
involved in constructing portfolio management strategies we'd like to fill.

# Details of the `ExpectedReturns` project & Impact


Mentors will guide your understanding of the topic, support your use of best 
practices in software development for quantitative finance using `R`, and 
provide market data for validating these approaches.

Ultimately, this work will be organized into an open source `R` package. It will 
complement the text and provide data, functions, and reproducible examples to 
guide academics, practitioners, and hobbyists in the `R` community in applying 
the work to their own research or portfolio management endeavors.

Students engaged in this project will obtain a deeper understanding of:  
i) Data Science applications in finance  
ii) Quantitative Analysis of active portfolio management  

## Areas of Interest

### Data

Most underlying data series are extracted from Bloomberg, including MSCI Barra’s
equity indices, Barclays Capital and other banks’ bond indices, and S&P GSCI
commodity futures indices. 
Other key sources include [Kenneth French’s](http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html), [Robert Shiller’s](http://www.econ.yale.edu/�shiller/data.htm), and [AQR's websites](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Datasets).

To create long data histories for major asset classes, the author concatenated 
best quality recent data and best available older data series. Most exhibits 
display total returns denominated in U.S. dollars; but some exhibits show real 
(inflation-adjusted) returns or excess returns over cash or over 
maturity/duration-matched Treasuries.

### Approaches to Dynamic asset weighting

**Carry strategies**, Chapter 13.

The academic literature on currency carry had already begun by around 1980 but 
the renaissance occurred in recent years with notable papers by Lustig–Verdelhan 
(2007), Brunnermeier–Nagel–Pedersen (2008), Farhi et al. (2009), Jurek (2009), 
and Burnside et al. (2010a). 

Among practitioner work, see Bilson (1993) and Nordvig (2007). 

On other predictors than carry, see Ilmanen–Sayood (2002), Yilmaz (2009), and 
Ang–Chen (2010). 

On carry strategies in various asset classes, see Cochrane (1999), 
Asness–Moskowitz–Pedersen (2009), and Bacchetta–Mertens–van Wincoop (2009).


### Return Factors and their risk premia



**Inflation factor and inflation premium**, Chapter 17

For a historical perspective on the inflation factor, see Ferguson (2007),
Greenspan (2007), and Reinhart–Rogoff (2008, 2009). 

On the economic impact of inflation, see Barro (1995). 

On the relation between inflation and equity returns, see Fama–Schwert (1979),

**Liquidity factor and illiquidity premium**, Chatper 18.

Given the growing interest on liquidity, an excellent survey by 
Amihud–Mendelson–Pedersen (2005) is gradually becoming outdated. 

On the relation of liquidity premia with business and monetary cycles, see 
Jensen–Moorman (2010) and Naes–Skjeltorp–Odegaard (2011).

On liquidity droughts, see Brunnermeier (2009), Brunnermeier–Pedersen (2009),
Garleanu–Pedersen (2009a), Nagel (2009), Pedersen (2009), and Duffie (2010).

**Tail risks (volatility, correlation, skewness)**, Chapter 19

On the time series relation between volatility and future market returns, see 
French–Schwert–Stambaugh (1987), Glosten–Jagannathan–Runkle (1993), Whitelaw (1994), Ghysels–Santa-Clara–Valkanov(2005), and Bollerslev–Zhou (2006).

On leverage constraints and the relative performance of low-beta and high-beta
assets, see Black (1972), Baker–Bradley–Wurgler (2010), and Frazzini–Pedersen (2010).

On correlation-related patterns, see Deng (2007), Driessen–Maenhout–Vilkov (2009),
Krishnan–Petkova–Ritchken (2008), Pollet–Wilson (2008) for equity markets and
Bhansali–Gingrich–Longstaff (2008), Longstaff–Rajan (2008), Coval–Jurek–Stafford
(2009) for debt markets. 

On hedge fund sensitivities to higher moments, see Bondarenko (2004), 
Agarwal–Bakshi–Huij (2007), Lo (2008), and Buraschi–Kosowski–Trojani
(2010). 

### Time-Varying Expected Returns

and Ghayur et al. (2010).

**Tactical return forecasting models**, Chapter 24: 

For examples of simple forecasting models in the bond market context, see
Ilmanen (1997), Ilmanen–Sayood (2002), and Naik–Balakrishnan–Devarajan (2009).

For an example of fair value models, see Panigirtzoglou–Loeys (2005). 

For books on quantitative forecasting models and trading approaches, all with 
equity orientation, see Grinold–Kahn (1999), Qian–Hua–Sorensen (2007), and 
Fabozzi–Focardi–Kolm (2010). 

On factor-mimicking portfolios, see Melas–Suryanarayanan–Cavaglia (2010). 

On econometric issues see Campbell–Lo–McKinlay (1996) and Cochrane (2005a).

**Cyclical variation in asset returns**, Chatper 26.

For examples of similar business cycle analysis, see Naik–Devarajan (2009) and 
Lustig–Verdelhan (2010). See Kaya–Lee–Pornrojnangkool (2010) and Ang–Bekaert 
(2002) for applications of regime-switching models.

## Tests

Students, please do one or more of the following tests before
contacting the mentors above. We encourage work on Linux Debian-based 
distributions.

1. **Easy:** Begin by downloading and building the `ExpectedReturns` and 
`FactorAnalytics` packages locally. Work through, and list any build errors or issues you encounter on install.

```{r}
library(remotes)
install_github("JustinMShea/ExpectedReturns")
install_github("braverock/FactorAnalytics")
```

2. **Intermediate:** Locate the `expected-returns-replications.Rmd` file in the `vignettes` directory. Refactor sections of this vignettes to replace functions
from the `plm` package with the `fitFfm` or `fitFfmDT` functions associated with
the `FactorAnalytics` package. This may include debugging upstream issues with 
merging data series, as well as reformatting data to match requirements of the 
new function arguments.

3. **Harder:** Reflect on the steps above. How do you interpret the results of
the new functions? In addition, was there any repetitious code in the vignette 
that may be written as a function for future use? If so please include it as an 
example. What data transformations or models might have benefited from writing 
unit tests? Please include examples for these as well.
