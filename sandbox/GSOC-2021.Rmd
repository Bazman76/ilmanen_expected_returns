# Background

A lack of portfolio diversification can severely impact the financial goals and 
long term plans for individual investment accounts, retirement accounts, 
University Endowment funds, and Municipal Pension funds alike. And as recent 
periods of financial market tumult has revealed, many investors are often not as 
diversified as they initially believe. While advisors are adept at packaging 
various financial products into "diversified portfolios", relationships among 
asset classes can change suddenly, upending the very diversification an 
otherwise meticulous crafted portfolio was built to provide. Why does 
diversification fail for so many precisely when it's most needed and what can be 
done? 

In this project, you shall explore and implement several investment strategies
that may enhance portfolio diversification with `R`, as discussed in one of the 
best investment references on the topic 
[Expected Returns: _An Investors Guide to Harvesting Market Rewards_](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Expected+Returns%3A+An+Investor%27s+Guide+to+Harvesting+Market+Rewards-p-9781119990727) by 
[Antti Ilmanen](https://www.aqr.com/About-Us/OurFirm/Antti-Ilmanen).

From the Description;

> This comprehensive reference delivers a toolkit for harvesting market rewards 
from a wide range of investments. Written by a world-renowned industry expert, 
the reference discusses how to forecast returns under different parameters. 
Expected returns of major asset classes, investment strategies, and the effects 
of underlying risk factors such as growth, inflation, liquidity, and different 
risk perspectives, are also explained. Judging expected returns requires 
balancing historical returns with both theoretical considerations and current 
market conditions. Expected Returns provides extensive empirical evidence, 
surveys of risk-based and behavioral theories, and practical insights.

# Related work

Your objective will be to reproduce key approaches suggested by the text and test 
performance on current market conditions with `R`. You will use functions found
in popular `R` in finance packages such as `FactorAnalytics`, 
`PerformanceAnalytics` and `PortfolioAnalytics`. But you will also need to write 
functions of your own to streamline workflows and implement solutions. While
these packages are excellent and widely used, there are gaps in the workflows
involved in constructing portfolio management strategies we'd like to fill.

# Details of the `ExpectedReturns` project & Impact


Mentors will guide your understanding of the topic, support your use of best 
practices in software development for quantitative finance using `R`, and 
provide market data for validating these approaches.

Ultimately, this work will be organized into an open source `R` package. It will 
complement the text and provide data, functions, and reproducible examples to 
guide academics, practitioners, and hobbyists in the `R` community in applying 
the work to their own research or portfolio management endeavors.

Students engaged in this project will obtain a deeper understanding of:  
i) Data Science applications in finance  
ii) Quantitative Analysis of active portfolio management  

## Areas of Interest

We'll focus on one or two broad sections with specific subsections to explore

- Approaches to Dynamic asset weighting
  * Value-oriented equity selection
  * Currency Carry
  * Commodity Momentum and Trend following
  
- Return Factors and their risk premia  
  * Inflation factor and inflation premium
  * Liquidity factor and liquidity premium
  * Tail risks (volatility, correlation, skewness)
  
### Data

Most underlying data series are extracted from Bloomberg, including MSCI Barra’s
equity indices, Barclays Capital and other banks’ bond indices, and S&P GSCI
commodity futures indices. 
Other key sources include [Kenneth French’s](http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html), [Robert Shiller’s](http://www.econ.yale.edu/�shiller/data.htm), and [AQR's websites](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Datasets).

To create long data histories for major asset classes, the author concatenated 
best quality recent data and best available older data series. Most exhibits 
display total returns denominated in U.S. dollars; but some exhibits show real 
(inflation-adjusted) returns or excess returns over cash or over 
maturity/duration-matched Treasuries.

### Approaches to Dynamic asset weighting

**Value-oriented equity selection**, chapter 12.

**Currency carry strategies**, Chapter 13.

**Commodity Momentum and trend following**, Chapter 14.

### Return Factors and their risk premia

**Inflation factor and inflation premium**, Chapter 17

**Liquidity factor and liquidity premium**, Chapter 18.

**Tail risks (volatility, correlation, skewness)**, Chapter 19


### We envision the following steps for this project:

* Skim the text above
* Get familiar with the [ExpectedReturns project](https://github.com/JustinMShea/ExpectedReturns/tree/master/vignettes).
* Refactor, document, and unify existing functions, adding new ones as needed.
* Refactor case studies in existing vignettes and unify them with the 
`FactorAnalytics` R package functions.
* Convert existing vignettes to static vignettes
* Add Unit tests using the `tinytest` R package
* Work with mentors to reproduce additional investment strategies as short 
vignettes, following 1 or 2 relevant papers

# Student-developer

## Tests

Students, please do one or more of the following tests before
contacting the mentors above. We encourage work on Linux Debian-based 
distributions.

1. **Easy:** Begin by downloading and building the `ExpectedReturns` and 
`FactorAnalytics` packages locally. Work through, and list any build errors or issues you encounter on install.  

```{r}
library(remotes)
install_github("JustinMShea/ExpectedReturns")
install_github("braverock/FactorAnalytics")
```

2. **Intermediate:** Locate the `expected-returns-replications.Rmd` file in the `vignettes`
directors. Refactor sections of this vignettes to replace functions using the `plm`
package with the `fitFfm` or `fitFfmDT` functions from the `FactorAnalytics` package. This may include debugging upstream issues with merging data series, as well as formatting data to match requirements of the new functions.

3. **Harder:** Reflect on the steps above. How do you interpret the results of the
newly factored models? Was there any repetitious code that may be written as 
a function for future use? If so please include it as an example.
What data transformations or models might have benefited from writing unit tests?
Please include examples for these as well.
