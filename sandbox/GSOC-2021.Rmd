# Background

A lack of portfolio diversification can severely impact the financial goals and 
long term plans for individual investment accounts, retirement accounts, 
University Endowment funds, and Municipal Pension funds alike. And as recent 
periods of financial market tumult has revealed, many investors are often not as 
diversified as they initially believe. While advisors are adept at packaging 
various financial products into "diversified portfolios", relationships among 
asset classes can change suddenly, upending the very diversification an 
otherwise meticulous crafted portfolio was built to provide. Why does 
diversification fail for so many precisely when it's most needed and what can be 
done? 

In this project, you shall explore and implement several investment strategies
that may enhance portfolio diversification with `R`, as discussed in one of the 
best investment references on the topic 
[Expected Returns: _An Investors Guide to Harvesting Market Rewards_](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Expected+Returns%3A+An+Investor%27s+Guide+to+Harvesting+Market+Rewards-p-9781119990727) by 
[Antti Ilmanen](https://www.aqr.com/About-Us/OurFirm/Antti-Ilmanen).

From the Description;

> This comprehensive reference delivers a toolkit for harvesting market rewards 
from a wide range of investments. Written by a world-renowned industry expert, 
the reference discusses how to forecast returns under different parameters. 
Expected returns of major asset classes, investment strategies, and the effects 
of underlying risk factors such as growth, inflation, liquidity, and different 
risk perspectives, are also explained. Judging expected returns requires 
balancing historical returns with both theoretical considerations and current 
market conditions. Expected Returns provides extensive empirical evidence, 
surveys of risk-based and behavioral theories, and practical insights.

# Related work

Your objective will be to reproduce key approaches suggested by the text and test 
performance on current market conditions with `R`. You will use functions found
in popular `R` in finance packages such as `FactorAnalytics`, 
`PerformanceAnalytics` and `PortfolioAnalytics`. But you will also need to write 
functions of your own to streamline workflows and implement solutions. While
these packages are excellent and widely used, there are gaps in the workflows
involved in constructing portfolio management strategies we'd like to fill.

# Details of the `ExpectedReturns` project & Impact


Mentors will guide your understanding of the topic, support your use of best 
practices in software development for quantitative finance using `R`, and 
provide market data for validating these approaches.

Ultimately, this work will be organized into an open source `R` package. It will 
complement the text and provide data, functions, and reproducible examples to 
guide academics, practitioners, and hobbyists in the `R` community in applying 
the work to their own research or portfolio management endeavors.

Students engaged in this project will obtain a deeper understanding of:  
i) Data Science applications in finance  
ii) Quantitative Analysis of active portfolio management  

## Areas of Interest

We'll focus on one or two broad sections with specific subsections to explore

- Approaches to Dynamic asset weighting
  * Value-oriented equity selection
  * Currency Carry
  * Commodity Momentum and Trend following
  
- Return Factors and their risk premia  
  * Inflation factor and inflation premium
  * Liquidity factor and illiquidity premium
  * Tail risks (volatility, correlation, skewness)
  
### Data

Most underlying data series are extracted from Bloomberg, including MSCI Barra’s
equity indices, Barclays Capital and other banks’ bond indices, and S&P GSCI
commodity futures indices. 
Other key sources include [Kenneth French’s](http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html), [Robert Shiller’s](http://www.econ.yale.edu/�shiller/data.htm), and [AQR's websites](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Datasets).

To create long data histories for major asset classes, the author concatenated 
best quality recent data and best available older data series. Most exhibits 
display total returns denominated in U.S. dollars; but some exhibits show real 
(inflation-adjusted) returns or excess returns over cash or over 
maturity/duration-matched Treasuries.

### Approaches to Dynamic asset weighting

**Value-oriented equity selection**, chapter 12.

**Currency carry strategies**, Chapter 13.

**Commodity Momentum and trend following**, Chapter 14.

### Return Factors and their risk premia

**Inflation factor and inflation premium**, Chapter 17

**Liquidity factor and illiquidity premium**, Chatper 18.

**Tail risks (volatility, correlation, skewness)**, Chapter 19


### We envision the following steps for this project:

* Skim the text above
* Get familiar with the [ExpectedReturns project](https://github.com/JustinMShea/ExpectedReturns/tree/master/vignettes).
* Refactor, document, and unify existing functions, adding new ones as needed.
* Refactor case studies in existing vignettes and unify them with the 
`FactorAnalytics` R package functions.
* Convert existing vignettes to static vignettes
* Add Unit tests using the `tinytest` R package
* Work with mentors to reproduce additional investment strategies as short 
vignettes, following 1 or 2 relevant papers

## Tests

Students, please do one or more of the following tests before
contacting the mentors above.

MENTORS: write several tests that potential students can do to
demonstrate their capabilities for this particular project.  Ask some
hard questions that will give you insight about how the students write
code to solve problems. You'll see that the harder the questions that
you ask, the easier it will be for you to choose between the students
that apply for your project!  Please modify the suggestions below to
make them specific for your project.

- Easy: something that any useR should be able to do, e.g. download
  some existing package listed in the Related Work, and run it on some
  example data.
- Medium: something a bit more complicated. You can encourage students
  to write a script or some functions that show their R coding
  abilities.
- Hard: Can the student write a package with Rd files, tests, and
  vignettes? If your package interfaces with non-R code, can the
  student write in that other language?

## Solutions of tests

Students, please post a link to your test results here.
