Description: Collection of tools to replicate key functionality from Antti Ilmanen's
  Expected Returns. Users will find worked examples from the book, and code to 
  parse, clean, and manipulate many of the data sets used in the book, as well as 
  equivalent/similar but possibly more accessible alternative data sources. 
  Additionally, the package provides general purpose functions such that users may 
  use their own data to apply models similar to those described in the book and 
  evaluate these models in current market conditions or in different markets than
  those utilized for the text.
