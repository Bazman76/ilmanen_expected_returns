# GSoC-2020-Expected-Returns-Ilmanen

## Background

As current market action has revealed, many investors are rarely as diversified 
as they believe they are. While many financial advisors sell diversification as 
a product, many fail to deliver in times of market turmoil. Why does diversification
fail precisly when it is most needed and what can be done to solve this modern day
portfolio management conundrum?

Through this project, you shall explore potential solutions to these 
challenging issues with one of the best investment references written
in the last two decades, [Expected Returns: _An Investors Guide to Harvesting Market Rewards_](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Expected+Returns%3A+An+Investor%27s+Guide+to+Harvesting+Market+Rewards-p-9781119990727) by [Antti Ilmanen](https://www.aqr.com/About-Us/OurFirm/Antti-Ilmanen).

Your objective will be to reproduce key sections of the work using best practices 
in software development for quantitative finance using `R` and/or `C`/`C++`. 
Mentors shall provide current, professional grade market data to mentees for 
exploring and validating these approaches. Ultimately, this work will be compiled 
and delivered as a complimentary, open source `R` package for all to use.

  

From the Description;

> This comprehensive reference delivers a toolkit for harvesting market rewards from a wide range of investments. Written by a world-renowned industry expert, the reference discusses how to forecast returns under different parameters. Expected returns of major asset classes, investment strategies, and the effects of underlying risk factors such as growth, inflation, liquidity, and different risk perspectives, are also explained. Judging expected returns requires balancing historical returns with both theoretical considerations and current market conditions. Expected Returns provides extensive empirical evidence, surveys of risk-based and behavioral theories, and practical insights.




Particular attention paid to two parts:

* The “Checklist” (10-step approach for integrated quantitative risk and portfolio management) 
* Factor Models and Statistical Learning (Multivariate statistics and machine learning for finance)

Students engaged in this project will obtain a deep understanding of
i) Data science for finance
ii) Quantitative risk management
iii) Quantitative portfolio management across asset management

(Potential papers, and chapters listed here)

We envision the following steps for this project:

* Familiarization with the text
* Work with the GSoC mentor(s) to lay out the script for that topic
* Gather data related to the project, which your GSoC mentors can access
* Write scripts using existing packages and custom functions if needed
* Develop this work using best practices in creating `R` packages.
* Complete minimal documentation using Roxygen2 & R markdown.

The project will be developed on https://github.com. In order to efficiently manage the development of the package, the various tasks and deadlines will be managed here.

## Mentors

Prof. Justin M. Shea, Prof. Brian Peterson, Peter Carl, and Erol Biceroglu.

In addition to the test above, applicants should demonstrate that they have:
* A very good working knowledge of programming in R, (with the potential to use Rcpp and C++). 
* Familiarity with the construction of R packages.
* Good coding standards (Google’s C++ and R style guide).
* Knowledge of Factor models and Active Portfolio Management
* Experience with multivariate statistics
* Experience with GitHub
* code for the `Expected Returns` project will be released under the [Affero Gnu Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html)
