# GSoC-2020-Expected-Returns-Ilmanen

## Background

[Expected Returns: _An Investors Guide to Harvesting Market Rewards_](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Expected+Returns%3A+An+Investor%27s+Guide+to+Harvesting+Market+Rewards-p-9781119990727) by [Antti Ilmanen](https://www.aqr.com/About-Us/OurFirm/Antti-Ilmanen) is one of the best investment references written this century.  

From the Description;

> This comprehensive reference delivers a toolkit for harvesting market rewards from a wide range of investments. Written by a world-renowned industry expert, the reference discusses how to forecast returns under different parameters. Expected returns of major asset classes, investment strategies, and the effects of underlying risk factors such as growth, inflation, liquidity, and different risk perspectives, are also explained. Judging expected returns requires balancing historical returns with both theoretical considerations and current market conditions. Expected Returns provides extensive empirical evidence, surveys of risk-based and behavioral theories, and practical insights.


Our goal is to reproducing key sections of the text and create a complimentary open source `R` package for the text.

Particular attention paid to two parts:

* The “Checklist” (10-step approach for integrated quantitative risk and portfolio management) 
* Factor Models and Statistical Learning (Multivariate statistics and machine learning for finance)

Students engaged in this project will obtain a deep understanding of
i) Data science for finance
ii) Quantitative risk management
iii) Quantitative portfolio management across asset management


## Related work

(Potential papers, and chapters listed here)

We envision the following steps for this project:

* Familiarization with the text
* Work with the GSoC mentor(s) to lay out the script for that topic
* Gather data related to the project, which your GSoC mentors can access
* Write scripts using existing packages and custom functions if needed
* Develop this work using best practices in creating `R` packages.
* Complete minimal documentation using Roxygen2 & R markdown.

The project will be developed on https://github.com. In order to efficiently manage the development of the package, the various tasks and deadlines will be managed here.

## Mentors

Prof. Justin M. Shea, Prof. Brian Peterson, Peter Carl, and Erol Biceroglu.
