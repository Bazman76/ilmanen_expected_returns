# Introduction
These notes aim at reproducing several works on factors modeling and their comparisons. The framework is the one adopted by \textcite{hou-al-2018}, who systematically examine how seemingly different factor models are related among each other.

# Q-factor models

## q-factor model 
In this section we strive to replicate the model introduced by \textcite{hou-al-2014}.

## $q^5$ factor model
In this section we strive to replicate the model introduced by \textcite{hou-al-2020}.
