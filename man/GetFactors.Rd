\title{Scrape Academic Financial Data Libraries

This is a convenience function to provide an easy way to download research
financial data sets from several accredited sources.
Specifically, it allows to import them in the `R` environment as `xts` objects.

The scientific libraries here contemplated are from several researchers as,
unfortunately, an open source systematic collection is not available at this
time. On one hand, these resources - of admirable effort - lack important features
(financial) databases guarantee; most notably, this results in the impossibility
to leverage APIs as in most cases there aren't any.
On the other hand, these data sets satisfy important characteristics: they are
open sourced, public and free to use, collected by world renowned Researchers
of the field (Nobel Laureates in some instances, as is the case for
Prof. *Eugene F. Fama* and Prof. *Robert J. Shiller*).

TODO: provide a general overview of data made available
In the case of the Fama-French's online library, generally stock data is obtained
from the *Center for Research in Security Prices, LLC* (CRSP) and the risk-free
rate is from *Ibbotson and Associates, Inc.* or *Bloomberg* databases.

Please be considerate while using the function. In particular, do not send too
frequent requests to the web source as the supported/tolerated request rate is
unknown. Usage remains at your own discretion and responsibility.
TODO: deal with loops internally so to include some sleeping time?

\item{term}{A character to be additionally provided when `x='REV'`. Either 'ST' (short-term, default) or 'LT' (long term).}

\item{country}{A character indicating for which country Fama-French's factors are wanted. Default is U.S. factors. See 'Details' for other countries are available.
# @param verbose A boolean, whether or not to retrieve additional info on data sets being downloaded. Not currently used.

TODO: `verbose`, if ever needed/wanted, should include Fama-French's data 'details' to provide factor construction info}
}
\value{
An `xts` object with columns being the requested factors over the whole period available.

TODO: document the object columns and their name

WARNING: We are not in a position to interact directly with the online library
via an API and there could be possible inconsistencies in source files formatting.
Given this shaking foundations and despite our efforts to guarantee an optimal
result, it could happen that data obtained is not what expected.
A sign that the data file downloaded may be incomplete is the lack of the header
as specified above.

\details{
The parameter `country` can specify one of those "country" (country or region)
made available by Fama-French.
Countries they make available are 'Asia Pacific ex Japan', 'Developed',
'Developed ex US', 'Emerging', 'Europe', 'Japan', 'North America' and
'United States' (the 'domestic'country with respect to which the standard
Fama-French's factors are computed, with markets being NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ).

The `RF` column refers the risk-free rate (e.g., 1-month TBill return for the
U.S.).

Fama-French often indicate missing data by -99.99 or -999.

Also, note that not all the Fama-French's series are available with respect to
all the possible frequencies specifiable with `freq`.
In particular, with respect to factor data, weekly data frequency is available
for the three-factor model only.
